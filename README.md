# Working with CRS, sf


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) in R with the sf package. We first want to give you an overview of the concepts you need to understand in order to potentially use this tool for your future work. In the life session we want to show you some coding examples in practice!

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) provide explanations about the concepts behind CRS like datums and projections, (2) give you an overview of easy applications of the sf package in practice, and (3) provide you with useful practice material as well as some further readings that will help you to deepen your understanding of the topic after this rather short introduction.
